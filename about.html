  <h1>About My First Capstone Project</h1>
  <h2>My Journey of Becoming a Web Developer</h2>
  <p>
    I am an aspiring web developer building my foundation through disciplined, hands-on learning and real-world projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    This portfolio represents my very first capstone project, and it was completed under conditions that required more than just technical understanding. While learning to publish my work online, I encountered unexpected access and hosting limitations related to regional internet infrastructure. At times, correctly deployed projects appeared inaccessible, not due to errors in code or configuration, but due to external delivery constraints beyond my control.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than abandon the process, I treated these challenges as part of my education—learning how hosting platforms work, how to isolate problems, and how to verify solutions across different environments. This experience reinforced an important lesson for me: real-world development is not only about writing correct code, but also about persistence, diagnosis, and adaptability.
  </p>
  <p>
    I continue to learn, build, and publish with a long-term goal of becoming a reliable, thoughtful, and globally competent developer—regardless of location or limitations.
